    "* DATASET - In Phase 1 part of the project, we used an interesting dataset that helped us to predict the prices of used cars in the country 'India', which is also known as the Second most populous country with an average population of 1.3 billion and about 296 million running/registered vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ATTRIBUTES - The dataset contained various columns/attributes namely: Unnamed: 0, Name, Location, Year, Kilometers_Driven, Fuel_Type, Transmission, Owner_Type, Mileage, Engine, Power, Seats and the target feature, that is Price.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DROPPING ATTRIBUTES - However, there were some attributes that were not very useful for predicting the price of the car. In order to keep the dataset accurate, we started by dropping the columns/attributes that were not very useful. This process took place in the section - 'Data Cleaning and Preprocessing'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DROPPED VALUES - The values that we dropped were -  Unnamed: 0, new_price and Name.\n",

    "* MISSING VALUES - For a dataset to be perfect and provide accurate results further, we need to make sure that there are no missing values in the whole dataset. For the same, we checked for any missing values by checking the ampount of missing values in all the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DROPPING OBSERVATIONS WITH MISSING VALUES - We found some missing values in the columns namely - Mileage, Engine, Power and Seats. For the dataset to be perfect, we dropped the observations with missing values and verified whether the missing values were successfully dropped to avoid any future errors in part 'Data Exploration and Visualisation'. Now, the whole dataset was considered to be cleaned. Then, we jumped to the part called 'Data Exploration and Visualisation'. In this part, we started exploring and visualising various features in combination with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DATA EXPLORATION AND VISUALISATION - In this part, we started exploring and visualising various features in combination with each other. We started by visualsing the data by plotting various one-variable, two-variable and three-variable plots in the form of various figures, graphs, boxplots, scatterplots and histograms taking into consideration different combinations that help us predict the prices of the used cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "* PLOTS - For two-variable plots we considered the combinations like  price-transmission, kilometers_driven - fuel_type, price - owner_type, etc. and for three-variable plots we considered the combinations like price - broken down by transmission and owner_type, price - broken down by owner_type and fuel_type, etc."
